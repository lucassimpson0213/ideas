# Personal GitHub Workflow (Succinct)

Goal: finish projects by giving each GitHub feature one job.

## The Pipeline

Idea → Active Work → Code → Understanding → Teaching

Mapped to:
**Issue → Project → Repo → Wiki → Blog (Zola)**

---

## 1) Issues — thinking & progress

Use for: ideas, plans, decisions, blockers, updates.
Do not put polished docs.

Rule: if you’re working on it, it has an issue.
Add short comments as checkpoints.

---

## 2) Projects — focus

A filtered view of issues.
Keep only 1–3 in **Doing**.

Question it answers: *What do I work on today?*

---

## 3) Repository — implementation

Contains only how to run the software:

* README (build/run)
* minimal architecture

Link the tracking issue in the README.

Question it answers: *How does it operate?*

---

## 4) Wiki — durable knowledge

Concepts and lessons learned:

* systems explanations
* mental models
* post‑project notes

No todos or daily logs.

Question it answers: *What did I learn?*

---

## 5) Zola — publication

Write after the project works and the wiki exists.
Clean explanation for others.

Question it answers: *What can I teach?*

---

## Rules

1. No project without an issue.
2. Progress goes in issues, not README.
3. Learning goes in wiki, not issues.
4. Blog only after completion.
5. Always cross‑link repo ↔ issue.

Outcome: low cognitive load and resumable projects.
